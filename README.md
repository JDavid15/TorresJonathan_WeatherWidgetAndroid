# TorresJonathan_WeatherWidgetAndroid

This is a Weather widget App that I developed at the university to show my Widgets and API's.

This app features a a widget that can inform the user about 3 seperate locations (Currently in Puerto Rico, California and Florida) and show the weather, temperature and more. If tapped on the widget, it will open the app and show a 3 day forcast on that location.

Installation: Intall the App via APK on any device (APK included in this GitHub file as "app-release.apk"), run in Android Stuio or Drag and Drop the APK file ("app-release.apk") on a Android Stuio Phone Emulator

The app dosen't have a tappable icon to open it. To test and Use the app, install the app, then open the widgets tabs on the device and drag and drop ("TorresJonathan_CE03") to the screen like you would any other widget.
